TASK 3:

 Step1: first we are going to add a new user named 'osc' by "sudo + useradd + the user's name", then we will set the password by the "sudo + passwd + the user's name".
 
 now to make a new group named 'osc_group' we will use "sudo + groupadd + the group's name".
 
 now to add the previous user to this group we will use "sudo + usermod + -a -G + the group's name + the user's name".
 
 now we have to add the 'osc' user to the sudors to give it the priviliges of the root user so, we will use "sudo + adduser + the user's name + sudo" and Done!
 
 to switch to this new user use "sudo + su - + the user's name". 
 
 Step2: because of i didn't use '-m' with "useradd" command, there wasn't a home directory for the user so i used "sudo mkhomedir_helper + the user's name" to make a home dir. for the user then switch to the osc user.
 
 if we used "pwd" now we are in the home directory of the user.
 
 we will make a new dir. with "mkdir" command, and 3 files in it with "touch" command.
 
 to change the permissions of them use "chmod" command, the public file should heve read and write permission for the all so its command will be "chmod a+rw + file's name" --> 'a' for all, '+' for add, 'rw' for read and write.
 
 for the private file the command will be "chmod u+rw + the file's name"--> 'u' for the user, for the rest we can just use numbers "chomd 600" -> '6' for the read and write and '0' for nothing.
 
 for the last file the executable --> "chomd 750" --> '7' for the rwx permission for the user and '5' for rx permission for the group .
 
 Step3: to change the owner of the file use "sudo chown + the new owner + the file's name" .
  
 after to change the group of the file use "sudo chgrp + the new group + the file's name" .
 
 Step4: make sleep process at the background --> "sleep 1000 &" the '&' for make the process at the background.
 "jobs" to make sure it is working.
 now "ps" to get its PID.
 and "kill -9 + the PID" to kill the process using its id, '-9' for the kill signal.
 now "jobs" and it's killed!
 
 for this step to open vim use "vim + a name" and it will open, then "ctrl+z" to suspend it.
 now "jobs" and it is suspended.
 
 to kill this suspended process by its name use "pkill -9 + the name" or "killall -9 vim".
 
 and to verify that they are no longer running use "ps" command, if they aren't exist then they are no longer running!
 
 Step5: to instal 'neofetch' package use "sudo apt install neofetch" command, and to uninstall it use "sudo apt remove neofetch" command.
